# my wallpaper collection

ive been collecting wallpapers for years now, thought i should just back it up on git.

feel free to download and use them as you wish, although some of them might be copyrighted so be careful if you use these online.

ps: i dont really keep a track of their sources so if you see something that belongs to you and want me to take it down, just let me know.

pps: if you'd like to add to this collection, feel free to make a pull request.

enjoy!
